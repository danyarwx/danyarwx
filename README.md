# 👋 Hey there, I'm Danila!

>Welcome to my kitchen. 👨‍🍳

## ⚡ About Me

- 🎓 Currently a student at **TUM University** (Technische Universität München), studying **Data Science and Management**.
- 🤖 Also, I’m working at an **AI startup** developing a chatbot to simplify the wild world of trade compliance. If you think that's a mouthful, you should see our codebase. 

## ⚔ What I Work With

- 🐍 **Python** Data, automation, ML - if it needs logic and elegance, I reach for Python.
- 🗃️ **SQL** Structured, sharp, and unforgiving if you don’t respect it.
- 💻 **C/C++** When performance matters. Also, when I feel like debugging with a blindfold on.
- 👩‍💻 **Bash** For when I want to automate pain.
- 🌷 **HTML** Building high-converting pages.
- ⚛️ **React** & 🟩 **Node.js** (Currently learning, so please excuse my React-ions)
- 🤹‍♂️ Always ready to pick up a new tech or debug an old one!

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- Building a chatbot that makes trade compliance less terrifying.
- Sharpening my frontend skills to make my projects both beautiful and functional.
